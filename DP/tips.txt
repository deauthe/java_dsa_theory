DP: a technique in programming that helps to efficiently solve
a class of problems that have overlapping subproblems(problems repeat) 
and optimal substructure(depends on smaller problems)
property


to identify dp problems:
 it has to be an optimal problem(bes, worst, least, max, min, etc)
 some choice is given(multiple branches in recursiion tree)
